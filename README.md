# Dexter

Dexter is a multi-agent AI assistant orchestrator designed to help automate tasks through clarifying dialogues, collaborative large language models, and sandboxed skill creation. This repository is a fresh start inspired by the gliksbot project, incorporating improvements outlined in `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`.

## Structure

- `backend/` – Python server code for autonomy, collaboration, skill management, and CLI interaction.
- `frontend/` – React-based web interface (work in progress) for interacting with Dexter.

## Getting Started

This repository is under active development. See `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` for high-level goals and planned features.
